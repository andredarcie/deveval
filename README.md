# DevEval Project

DevEval is a robust application for system evaluation and management, designed using a clean, modular, and scalable architecture. This project organizes its logic into well-defined layers, making it easier to maintain, test, and extend.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project follows a modular approach inspired by **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles, divided into several layers:

- **src/DevEval.Application**  
  Contains the application layer, responsible for orchestrating domain logic and interacting with external interfaces. Includes:
  - **Commands**: Represent intent and encapsulate all data required to execute specific operations (e.g., `LoginUserCommand`, `CreateCartCommand`, `ConvertCartToSaleCommand`).
  - **Handlers**: Execute business logic by interacting with the domain layer (e.g., `LoginUserHandler`, `CancelSaleItemHandler`).
  - **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used to transfer data between layers and external clients (e.g., `CartDto`, `ProductDto`, `SaleDto`, `UserDto`).
  - **Profiles**: AutoMapper profiles to map domain models to DTOs, maintaining separation of concerns.

- **src/DevEval.Domain**  
  Represents the core of the application, focusing on business rules and domain logic. Implements core DDD patterns:
  - **Entities**: Unique objects with an identity that persists over time (e.g., `Cart`, `Product`, `User`, `Sale`, `SaleItem`).
  - **Value Objects**: Immutable types representing concepts without a unique identity (e.g., `Address`, `Rating`).
  - **Repositories**: Abstract interfaces for data access, enabling the persistence and retrieval of domain entities while maintaining a separation from infrastructure concerns.
  - **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects (entities and value objects) that are treated as a single unit. For example, `Cart` may act as an aggregate root, encapsulating `CartProduct`.

- **src/DevEval.Common**  
  Contains shared utilities and abstractions to support the application and domain layers:
  - **Pagination**: Helpers for paginating large datasets (e.g., `PaginationHelper`, `PaginatedResult`).
  - **Sorting**: Logic for sorting collections dynamically (e.g., `SortingHelper`).
  - **Base Classes**: Abstract implementations for common patterns (e.g., `ValueObject`, `Repository`).

- **src/DevEval.WebApi**  
  Acts as the interface layer, exposing the domain and application logic via RESTful APIs. Adheres to **CQRS** principles by separating query and command responsibilities:
  - **Controllers**:
    - `AuthController`: Handles authentication and token generation.
    - `CartsController`: Manages cart-related operations (CRUD, checkout).
    - `ProductsController`: Manages products, including category-based filtering.
    - `SalesController`: Handles the sales lifecycle.
    - `UsersController`: Manages user operations such as registration and updates.
  - **Middleware**: Implements cross-cutting concerns, such as:
    - `ErrorHandlingMiddleware`: Centralized handling of exceptions with consistent responses.
  - **Configuration Files**:
    - `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` for managing environment-specific settings.
  - **Deployment**:
    - `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to facilitate containerized deployments.

- **test/DevEval.Test**  
  Implements automated tests to ensure application quality and robustness:
  - **Handlers**: Tests for application handlers to validate business logic (e.g., `LoginUserHandlerTests`, `CancelSaleItemHandlerTests`).
  - **Profiles**: Tests for AutoMapper mappings (e.g., `CartProfileTests`, `ProductProfileTests`).
  - **Entities**: Tests for domain entities to verify business rules (e.g., `CartTests`, `ProductTests`, `SaleTests`).
  - **Value Objects**: Tests for value objects to ensure immutability and validity (e.g., `AddressTests`).
  - **Project Configuration**: `DevEval.Test.csproj` consolidates all test files and dependencies.

### ðŸ’¡ Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles Applied

1. **Layered Architecture**:  
   - Separation of concerns between application logic (`Application`), domain rules (`Domain`), and infrastructure (`WebApi`, `Common`).

2. **Entities and Value Objects**:  
   - Core domain objects (e.g., `Cart`, `Sale`, `User`) ensure domain integrity.
   - Value objects (e.g., `Address`) enforce immutability and equality comparison.

3. **Repositories**:  
   - Abstract interfaces isolate domain logic from persistence details.

4. **Aggregates**:  
   - Aggregate roots like `Cart` and `Sale` control access to related entities, ensuring consistency.

5. **CQRS**:  
   - Commands (`CreateCartCommand`, `ConvertCartToSaleCommand`) handle state changes.
   - Queries (`GetProductsQuery`, `GetCartsQuery`) retrieve data without side effects.

6. **Ubiquitous Language**:  
   - Aligns code structure and terminology (e.g., `Cart`, `Checkout`, `Sale`) with domain experts to improve understanding.

7. **Exception Handling**:  
   - Middleware centralizes exception management, adhering to **fail-fast** and **single responsibility** principles.
